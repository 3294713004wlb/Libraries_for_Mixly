# BH1750

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/claws/BH1750.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/claws/BH1750)<br>

This package contains an Arduino library for digital light sensor breakout boards containing the
BH1750FVI IC.

The BH1750 board uses I2C for communication which requires two pins to
communicate with the device. Configuring the I2C bus must be done in user code
(not library code). This approach has been adopted so it can be done once and
will better support the various options for different platforms.

A common module containing the BH1750 component is the GY-30 shown below.

## Overview

The BH1750 has six different measurement modes which are divided in two groups;
continuous and one-time measurements. In continuous mode the sensor
continuously measures lightness value. In one-time mode, the sensor makes only
one measurement and then goes into Power Down mode.

Each mode has three different precisions:

  - Low Resolution Mode - (4 lx precision, 16ms measurement time)
  - High Resolution Mode - (1 lx precision, 120ms measurement time)
  - High Resolution Mode 2 - (0.5 lx precision, 120ms measurement time)

By default, this library uses Continuous High Resolution Mode, but you can
change this to a different mode by passing the mode argument to
BH1750.begin().

When the One-Time mode is used your sensor will go into Power Down mode when
it completes the measurement and you've read it. When the sensor is powered up
again it returns to the default mode which means it needs to be reconfigured
back into One-Time mode. This library has been implemented to automatically
reconfigure the sensor when you next attempt a measurement so you should not
have to worry about such low level details.

Usually you will get an integer value which represent the lux equivalent.
  - Low Resolution Mode - (generic range: 0.0 up to 54612.5 lux)
  - High Resolution Mode - (generic range: 0.0 up to 54612.5 lux)
  - High Resolution Mode 2 - (generic range: 0.0 up to 27306.25 lux)

The sensor itself returns a 16 bit unsigned integer. Therefore the maximum value is limited in general. 
The standard conversion between the so called 'counts' to lux is 1/1.2, that means you get a smaller value.
As we use float, if an error occurs you will get a negative value.
  - -1 no valid data was transmitted from the sensor
  - -2 device is not configured
Otherwise the measured counts are converted to lux and returned. If no advanced parameters are changed the maximum lux value is 54612.5 lx. 
  
As the sensor counts impact of light in a specific time frame you could change this time frame. 
This is needed if you use an overlay windows or compensate environmental influence like darkness.
This time frame is defined by a register which is called MTreg. Therefore you could choose a value between 32 and 254.
The default value is 69; keep in mind that the measurement time is changed accordingly.

## Installation

Click "Clone or download" -> "Download ZIP" button.

  - **(For Arduino >= 1.5.x)** Use the way above, or Library Manager. Open Arduino
    IDE, click `Sketch -> Include library -> Add .ZIP library ` and select the
    downloaded archive.

  - **(For Arduino < 1.5.x)** Extract the archive to
    ``<Your User Directory>/My Documents/Arduino/libraries/`` folder and rename it
    to `BH1750`. Restart IDE.

The following YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/ACTMQvPVMLs) (specifically from
7:20 onwards) provides a good overview of installing this library and loading
an example using the Arduino IDE.

## Example

An example using the BH1750 library in conjunction with the GY-30 board
(which contains the BH1750 component) is presented below. The example
code uses the BH1750 library in the default continuous high precision
mode when making light measurements.

### Wiring

Connections:

  - VCC -> 3V3 or 5V
  - GND -> GND
  - SCL -> SCL (A5 on Arduino Nano, Uno, Leonardo, etc or 21 on Mega and Due, on esp8266 free selectable)
  - SDA -> SDA (A4 on Arduino Nano, Uno, Leonardo, etc or 20 on Mega and Due, on esp8266 free selectable)
  - ADD -> NC/GND or VCC (see below)

The ADD pin is used to set the sensor I2C address. By default (if ADD voltage
less than 0.7 * VCC) the sensor address will be 0x23. If it has voltage
greater or equal to 0.7VCC voltage (e.g. you've connected it to VCC) the
sensor address will be 0x5C.

Wiring up the GY-30 sensor board to an Arduino is shown in the diagram below.

*The image above was created using [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/) and
the GY-30 module was obtained from [here](http://omnigatherum.ca/wp/?p=6)*.

### Code

Upload the BH1750 test code to your Arduino.

``` c++
#include <Wire.h>
#include <BH1750.h>

BH1750 lightMeter;

void setup(){

  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Initialize the I2C bus (BH1750 library doesn't do this automatically)
  // On esp8266 devices you can select SCL and SDA pins using Wire.begin(D4, D3);
  Wire.begin();

  lightMeter.begin();
  Serial.println(F("BH1750 Test"));

}

void loop() {

  float lux = lightMeter.readLightLevel();
  Serial.print("Light: ");
  Serial.print(lux);
  Serial.println(" lx");
  delay(1000);

}
```

### Output

Moving the sensor to face more light results in the lux measurements increasing.
```
BH1750 Test
Light: 70.0 lx
Light: 70.0 lx
Light: 59.0 lx
Light: 328.0 lx
Light: 333.0 lx
Light: 335.0 lx
Light: 332.0 lx
```
